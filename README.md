# Limework fork of RedisBungee

[![RedisBungee Build](https://github.com/Limework/RedisBungee/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Limework/RedisBungee/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

Spigot link: [click](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/redisbungee.87700/)

The maintainer of RedisBungee has became inactive, so we have taken the development of the plugin.

RedisBungee bridges [Redis](https://redis.io) and [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) together. 


This is currently deployed on [Govindas Limework!](https://Limework.net) 

## Compiling

Now you can use maven without installing it using Maven wrapper [github?](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper) :)

RedisBungee is distributed as a [maven](https://maven.apache.org) project. To compile it and install it in your local Maven repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Limework/RedisBungee.git
    cd RedisBungee
    mvnw clean install

And use it in your pom file.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.imaginarycode.minecraft</groupId>
      <artifactId>RedisBungee</artifactId>
      <version>0.6.2</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>

## Javadocs

## Configuration

**REDISBUNGEE REQUIRES A REDIS SERVER**, preferably with reasonably low latency. The default [config](https://github.com/limework/RedisBungee/blob/master/src/main/resources/example_config.yml) is saved when the plugin first starts.
