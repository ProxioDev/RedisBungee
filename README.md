# RedisBungee Limework's Fork

The original project of RedisBungee is no longer maintained, so we have forked the plugin.
RedisBungee uses [Redis](https://redis.io) with Java client [Jedis](https://github.com/redis/jedis/)
to Synchronize players data between [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord)
or [Velocity*](https://github.com/PaperMC/Velocity) proxies
